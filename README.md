Description:
As part of the In Vitro Diagnostics(IVD) System, the samples are pre-heated for specific temperature. A PID Controller controls the temperature to specific set values by the user. The developed application reads the "temperature log" CSV file using python and displays line chart of the following parameters using java script, html and css
Actual Temperature
Set Temperature
This code is a very useful tool to understand the temperature characteristics of the IVD Systems like error between actual and set values, time to reach the set values, over shoots and under shoots etc.
